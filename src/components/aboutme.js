            It was late last year (2017) when I wrote my first console.log('Hello World!'). Shortly after I realized that web development was my new found passion and from that point, I hit the ground running by investing 100% of my time to coding. I started taking courses online and in February 2018 I enrolled into an on-site 3-month coding boot camp at Wyncode Academy which I recently graduated from. I am now seeking an opportunity to apply my management experience and coding skills to a company with whom I share the same passion and vision to help them grow and expand.
